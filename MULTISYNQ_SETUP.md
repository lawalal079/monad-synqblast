# ðŸš€ Multisynq Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

Your **Monad Synqblast** game now includes **Multisynq** integration for real-time multiplayer functionality! This satisfies Mission 6 requirements by adding novel Multisynq usage to your blockchain game.

## What Multisynq Adds

### ðŸŽ® Real-Time Multiplayer Features:
- **Live Reactor Synchronization** - See other players' reactors deploy in real-time
- **Multiplayer Phase Sync** - All players see the same game phase simultaneously  
- **Real-Time Leaderboard** - Live updates across all connected players
- **Connected Players Counter** - See how many players are online
- **Shared Game State** - Synchronized game rounds and events

### ðŸ”— Integration Points:
- **ReactorControls** - Broadcasts reactor deployments to all players
- **GameBoard** - Shows reactors from all players in real-time
- **Layout** - Displays connection status and player count
- **Phase Management** - Synchronized game phases across players

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Multisynq API Key
1. Visit [multisynq.io/coder](https://multisynq.io/coder)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your API key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTISYNQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Deploy and Test
1. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open multiple browser tabs to test multiplayer sync

2. **Production Deployment:**
   - Add the Multisynq API key to your Vercel environment variables
   - Deploy as usual - Multisynq will work automatically

## How It Works

### Real-Time Architecture
```
Player A deploys reactor â†’ Multisynq Model â†’ All connected players see it instantly
Player B triggers reactor â†’ Multisynq Model â†’ Real-time chain reaction sync
Phase changes â†’ Multisynq Model â†’ All players transition together
```

### Code Integration
- **MultisynqGameModel.js** - Handles game state synchronization
- **MultisynqGameSync.tsx** - React integration wrapper
- **useMultisynq()** hook - Used in GameBoard and ReactorControls

## Mission 6 Compliance âœ…

Your project now satisfies **all Mission 6 requirements**:

âœ… **Open Source** - Available on GitHub  
âœ… **Uses Multisynq** - Real-time multiplayer integration  
âœ… **Interacts with Monad Testnet** - Blockchain transactions  
ðŸŽ¯ **Bonus: Silly/Fun** - Chain reaction explosions are definitely fun!

## Testing Multiplayer

1. **Open Multiple Tabs** - Same browser, different tabs
2. **Share Session URL** - QR code widget appears for easy sharing
3. **Deploy Reactors** - Watch them appear on all connected screens
4. **Trigger Reactions** - See real-time chain reactions sync
5. **Check Player Count** - Top-right corner shows connected players

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **"Connecting..." Status** - Check API key in environment variables
- **Reactors Not Syncing** - Ensure all players are in same session
- **Phase Desync** - Refresh page to rejoin synchronized session

### Debug Mode:
Check browser console for Multisynq logs:
- `ðŸŽ® Multisynq session joined: [session-id]`
- `ðŸŽ® Reactor deployed and synced with Multisynq`
- `ðŸŽ® Reactors triggered and synced with Multisynq`

## What's Next

Your **Monad Synqblast** game is now a fully functional **real-time multiplayer blockchain game** powered by Multisynq! 

### Potential Enhancements:
- **Voice Chat** - Add Multisynq voice integration
- **Player Avatars** - Show player cursors on the grid
- **Tournament Mode** - Synchronized competitive rounds
- **Spectator Mode** - Watch games without participating
